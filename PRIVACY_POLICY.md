1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK & COMPLIANCE
Platform Harmony: This project is engineered to strictly adhere to the TikTok Developer Terms and GitHub’s Open Source Standards.

Mutual Protection: We provide a safe, interactive layer that enhances TikTok's Live ecosystem without compromising the security or integrity of either platform.

2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & "THE ARCHITECT'S" RIGHTS
Creative Monopoly: The "Dramatic Conflict Engine," including its specific narrative algorithms, philosophical maze structures, and "Character Transformation" logic, remains the exclusive intellectual property of Ahmed Salama Hashem.

Trademarked Experience: No part of the dramatic "Visual Metaphors" or "Structural Audacity" developed here may be cloned or used for commercial purposes outside of this engine without explicit written consent.

3. DATA INTEGRITY & PROTAGONIST SAFETY
Zero-Persistence Policy: We do not store, harvest, or sell private user data. The engine operates on "Ephemeral Real-Time Processing," meaning data exists only for the duration of the dramatic session.

SDK Protocol: All interactions are handled through the official TikTok Live SDK, ensuring that TikTok maintains full control over its user environment.

4. CONTENT MODERATION & THE "HEROES' CODE"
Safety First: The engine includes a built-in "Dramatic Safety Valve" to ensure all philosophical debates remain within TikTok Community Guidelines.

Liability Shield: Neither the Creator (Ahmed Salama Hashem), TikTok, nor GitHub shall be held liable for the personal interpretations, debates, or emotional reactions of participants during the "Live Cinematic Experience".

5. COOPERATION & GROWTH STRATEGY
Economic Value: This engine is designed to drive "Gifting Economy" and "User Retention" on TikTok, providing a tangible ROI for the platform through high-value creative content.
