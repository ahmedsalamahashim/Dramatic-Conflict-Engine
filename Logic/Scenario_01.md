# Scenario 01: The Locked Chamber of Truth
**Objective:** To force a character transformation through a moral choice.

## 🎬 The Setup
Three guests find themselves in a "Virtual Locked Chamber." They have only 5 minutes of oxygen (Time Limit).

## 🔥 The Conflict
There is a "Key of Freedom," but it can only save TWO guests. The third must stay behind to keep the door open for the others.

## ⚡ Interactive Plot Twists (For Supporters)
- **The Oxygen Gift:** If a supporter sends a specific gift, 2 extra minutes are added to the debate.
- **The Traitor's Whisper:** A supporter can "pay" to send a private hint to one guest, giving them a secret advantage.
- **The Crowd's Veto:** If the comments reach a certain speed, the audience can force the guests to change their roles.

## 🏆 The Catharsis
The game ends when the guests reach a unanimous decision or the time runs out.
