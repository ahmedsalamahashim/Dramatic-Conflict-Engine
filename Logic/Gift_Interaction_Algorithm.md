# ⚙️ Interaction & Gifting Algorithm (IGA)
**Project:** Dramatic-Conflict-Engine

## 1. THE ARCHITECT'S LOGIC
This algorithm bridges the gap between audience generosity and narrative progression. Every gift on TikTok Live acts as a "Plot Catalyst" within the Cinematic Maze.

## 2. GIFT-TO-ACTION MAPPING
We categorize TikTok gifts into three dramatic tiers:

### Tier 1: The Whisper (Minor Gifts - e.g., Rose, Finger Heart)
* **Action:** Triggers a "Visual Hint" or a "Comment Highlight."
* **Dramatic Effect:** Gives a slight advantage to one of the protagonists (guests) in the philosophical debate.

### Tier 2: The Plot Twist (Mid-Range Gifts - e.g., Confetti, Paper Crane)
* **Action:** Activates the "Dramatic Safety Valve" or "Time Extension."
* **Dramatic Effect:** Adds 2 minutes to the timer or allows a guest to "Veto" an opponent's argument.

### Tier 3: The Deus Ex Machina (Major Gifts - e.g., Lion, Universe, Interstellar)
* **Action:** Complete Narrative Shift.
* **Dramatic Effect:** * **The Veto:** Instantly saves a guest from elimination.
    * **The Oracle:** Reveals a hidden truth that changes the entire philosophical dilemma.
    * **The Throne:** Grants the supporter the right to choose the next "Protagonist" from the queue.

## 3. AUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT METRICS
* **Sentiment Analysis:** The engine monitors comment velocity. High velocity triggers "The Chaos Mode" (Red Overlay).
* **Retention Loop:** Viewers who stay for more than 10 minutes gain "Spectator XP," allowing them to vote in the "The People's Jury."

**Technical Goal:** To maximize TikTok's Gifting Economy while maintaining a high-quality, cinematic narrative.
